Purpose of this folder is to test a common development and deployment file structure
suitable to meet the mTOP DDP and product build requirements:

In trunk are captured the working (SVN) revisions of all the DDPs.

In tags are captured a copy/snapshot of all the DDPs (revision) for a given release

mtosi_R2-0: First major release example with all 4 DDPs

mtosi_R2-1: First minor update of R2
- two minor extensions to the LayerRate XSD module in NRB
- two minor extensions to the CommonResourceInfo (COI) XSD module in NRB (new module&namespace)
- Changes illustrated in NRF DDP xml folder with me and md examples
All changes are minor (forward/backward compatible) as do not introduce namespace changes
