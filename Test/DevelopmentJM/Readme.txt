Purpose of this folder is to test a common development and deployment file structure
suitable to meet the mTOP DDP and product build requirements:

In trunk are captured the working (SVN) revisions of all the DDPs.

In tags are captured a copy/snapshot of all the DDPs (revision) for a given release
