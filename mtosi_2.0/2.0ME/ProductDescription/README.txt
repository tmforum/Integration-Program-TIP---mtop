README File for MTOSI release 2.0 (BA)

----------

BEFORE WE BEGIN: PLEASE ensure you extract the contents of all 
of the MTOSI DDPs you need into the SAME directory.

----------

This release is made of 10 Document Delivery Packages (DDPs).
Some of them may depend on artifacts defined in one or several other DDPs.
For this reason you may have to download and extract the contents
of more than one DDP.
Here below is the dependency graph between those 10 DDPs:

Each of the MTOSI zipfiles contains the contents of one DDP
at a specific release date and time.

You may need to download and unzip multiple DDPs to completely 
cover the MTOSI subinterfaces of interest to you. All of the
specification PDF documents are cross-linked.

All of the MTOSI zipfiles MUST be extracted using your favourite 
unzip/extract file program into the SAME directory.

On Windows XP the file browser's "Extract All" command will 
un-helpfully offer to extract the contents of this zipfile into
a directory specific to this DDP.  Unforutnately this will break
the specification PDF document cross-links.

Each DDP contains its own Release notes contained in the 
ProductDescription directory. This set of release notes contains
a detailed list of the documents contained in the whole of the
MTOSI 2.0 (BA) release at the time and date that the DDP zipfile
was created. If you have downloaded and extracted DDPs from the
same release date and time, it is highly likely that each of the 
DDP specific release notes will be the same.

----------

JUST TO BE SURE: PLEASE ensure you extract the contents of all 
of the MTOSI DDPs you need into the SAME directory.
