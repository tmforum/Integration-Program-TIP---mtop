README File for MTOSI release 2.0 (BA)

----------

BEFORE WE BEGIN: PLEASE ensure you extract the contents of all 
of the MTOSI DDPs you need into the SAME directory.

----------

Each of the MTOSI zipfiles contains the contents of one Document 
Delivery Package (DDP) at a specific release date and time.

You may need to download and unzip multiple DDPs to completely 
cover the MTOSI subinterfaces of interest to you. All of the
specification PDF documents are cross-linked.

All of the MTOSI zipfiles MUST be extracted using your favourite 
unzip/extract file program into the SAME directory.

On Windows XP the file browser's "Extract All" command will 
un-helpfully offer to extract the contents of this zipfile into
a directory specific to this DDP.  Unforutnately this will break
the specification PDF document cross-links.

Each DDP contains its own Release notes contained in the 
ProductDescription directory. This set of release notes contains
a detailed list of the documents contained in the whole of the
MTOSI 2.0 (BA) release at the time and date that the DDP zipfile
was created. If you have downloaded and extracted DDPs from the
same release date and time, it is highly likely that each of the 
DDP specific release notes will be the same.

----------

JUST TO BE SURE: PLEASE ensure you extract the contents of all 
of the MTOSI DDPs you need into the SAME directory.
